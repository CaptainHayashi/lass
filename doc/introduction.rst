Introduction to LASS
====================

What is LASS?
=============

`LASS` (the *Longevity Assured Site System*) is a Django project
providing the framework for a website suitable for student radio
stations.

It was originally written to replace the University Radio York website
(http://ury.org.uk), but is available under the GNU General Public
Licence version 2 for inspection and adaptation in other sites and
contexts.

Technically, `LASS` refers only to the collection of applications that
form the URY website codebase; the templates and static data that
complement the Django code to form a full website are separate
concerns.

Why would I need LASS?
======================

LASS is provided in the hopes that it may be helpful in part or in
whole to other amateur, community or student radio stations wishing to
build a website, as a free software bundle of existing solutions to
problems faced when URY built their website.

It also obviously continues to be developed as the backend codebase
for the URY site itself!  (At time of writing.)  As such, anyone is
welcome to extend or help develop it.

What is this documentation?
===========================

This is the semi-automated documentation for LASS, which combines
docstrings extracted from the actual LASS code with ancillary manual
documentation written by humans.

The aim is to serve as one centralised location for all information
about LASS and how to use, extend and improve it.

This document covers the integrated LASS project only; for the
individual app documentation see the
`URY project page <http://rtfd.org/profiles/UniversityRadioYork/>`_ on
ReadTheDocs.

Is this the only documentation?
===============================

This is the main source of documentation for LASS; in adherence to the
Don't Repeat Yourself principle, most if not all of the documentation
for the project is "baked in" as either docstrings or supporting files
bundled with the project.

However, this autodocumentation is admittedly likely to be lacking at
the start of the project and may lag behind the knowledge of the LASS
contributors.  If you find that something is poorly documented, see
:ref:`contributors` for details on how to contact the LASS
contributors for assistance.
