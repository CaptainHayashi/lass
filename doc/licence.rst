Why GPL2?
---------

We realise that the GPL2 is not the most optimal licence for this type
of Web application, and that the AGPL or permissive licences would
have suited the project better.

However, LASS is under the GPL2 due to the inclusion, at time of
writing, of the xapian-haystack search backend, which is indeed under
the GPL2.

This documentation
==================

As this documentation is mostly extracted from the GPL2 source, it is
also distributed under the terms of GPL2 (for better or worse).
