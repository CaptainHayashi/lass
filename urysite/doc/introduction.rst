What is LASS?
=============

`LASS` (the *Longevity Assured Site System*) is a Django project
providing a website suitable for student radio stations.

It was originally written to replace the University Radio York
website (http://ury.org.uk), but is available under the GNU General
Public Licence version 2 for inspection and adaptation in other
sites and contexts.

What is this documentation?
===========================

This is the semi-automated documentation for LASS, which combines
docstrings extracted from the actual LASS code with ancillary manual
documentation written by humans.

The aim is to serve as one centralised location for all information
about LASS and how to use, extend and improve it.
